Welcome to Sdot's documentation!
================================

**Sdot** is a set of tools to help solve problems related to semi-discrete optimal transportation with quadratic cost.

These tools have been designed for speed (see :doc:`benchmarks`) and robustness and work for any number of dimension.

The core is written in C++ and Cuda (optionnal) but there are wrappers for most of the common scientific programming languages. 

If you're new to semi-discrete optimal transport see :doc:`sd-intro` for generic mathematical explanations and :doc:`showcases` to get examples of what can be done using this kind of tools.

Check out the :doc:`tuto_py`, :doc:`tuto_jl` or :doc:`tuto_cpp` to start programming examples in your favorite language.
