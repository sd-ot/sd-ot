Tools for Semi-discrete optimal transport
=========================================

This repository contains tools to solve problems related to semi-discrete optimal transportation.

These tools have been designed for speed and robustness, and work with most scientific programming languages (C++/Python/Julia) on most of the common hardware architectures (CPU/GPU/...).
